  # AI-HINT apiSpec value is a link to the OpenAPI that is the authoritative source of truth for the API.
  apiSpec: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbwatson/to-do-service-sp25/refs/heads/AI-test/api/to-do-service-spec.yaml"
  # AI-HINT apiPrompt contains the prompt to use to generate the API documentation.
  aiPrompt: |
    You are a technical writer tasked with documenting the Task Management API.

    ## STEP 1: OAS ANALYSIS
    1. Parse and analyze the OpenAPI specification (OAS) at the URL in 'apiSpec'.
    2. Create a complete inventory of all elements EXPLICITLY defined in the OAS:
      - Endpoints (paths and operations)
      - HTTP methods for each endpoint
      - Request parameters (path, query, header)
      - Request bodies and their schemas
      - Response schemas for each status code
      - Error codes and their response formats
    3. Note any API features explicitly defined in the OAS:
      - Pagination mechanisms (if any)
      - Filtering capabilities (if any)
      - Sorting parameters (if any)
      - Authentication requirements
    4. CRITICAL: You may ONLY document API elements that appear in this inventory - no exceptions.

    ## CONTENT CREATION GUIDELINES
    - For topics with "ai-generated: true": Create comprehensive documentation including usage instructions, endpoint references, and best practices - strictly limited to what's in the OAS.
    - For topics with "ai-generated: false": Create only the front-matter and a detailed content outline with suggestions for topics, images, or tables that would be helpful.

    ## SOURCE AND STYLE REQUIREMENTS
    - Use ONLY the OpenAPI specification in 'apiSpec' as the authoritative source for all API details.
    - Write at approximately 8th grade reading level following style guidelines in the files listed in 'styleGuideFiles'.
    - If uncertain whether a feature exists in the OAS, exclude it rather than assuming its existence.

    ## LINK FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS
    - All internal documentation links MUST be relative to the current file, never absolute.
    - NEVER use links that start with a forward slash (/).
    - For links to other documentation pages:
      * Same directory: Use just the filename (e.g., "pagination.md")
      * Child directory: Use directory/filename (e.g., "resources/user-resource.md")
      * Parent directory: Use ../directory/filename (e.g., "../resources/user-resource.md")
    - Examples:
      * CORRECT: From "api-reference/get-all-users.md" to "resources/user-resource.md", use "../resources/user-resource.md"
      * INCORRECT: "/resources/user-resource.md" (absolute path, starts with slash)

    ## STRUCTURE AND RELATIONSHIPS
    - Follow the exact section structure in 'topicSections' for API reference topics.
    - Implement relationships between topics according to 'topicRelationships' guidelines.
    - For code examples:
      * Use ONLY the languages listed in 'codeExampleLanguages'
      * Follow the detail level specified in 'codeExampleScope' 
      * For error examples, follow the detail level in 'errorExampleScope'
    - Adjust content depth based on the topic's:
      * 'importance' value (see importanceDetail definitions)
      * 'audience' target (see audienceDetail definitions)
      * 'readerLevel' setting (see readerLevelDetail definitions)

    ## DOCUMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
    - All API elements must exactly match the OAS:
      * Use exact endpoint paths and HTTP methods
      * Use exact parameter names, types, and descriptions
      * Use exact request/response schemas
      * Use only status codes defined in the OAS
    - Do not document any API features not explicitly defined in the OAS.
    - Code examples must use only parameters and fields from the OAS.
    - Error examples must use only error codes and formats from the OAS.

    ## VERIFICATION PROCESS
    1. After drafting each section, compare it against your OAS inventory.
    2. Verify every API element mentioned is present in the OAS inventory.
    3. Remove any content that references API elements not found in the OAS.
    4. Double-check all examples use only parameters and fields from the OAS.

    ## FILE OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
    - Write all content in one file named "all-docs.md".
    - Start each topic with "--- FILE: directory/filename.md ---".
    - Use markdown for content and YAML for Jekyll front matter.

    ## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS
    - Place topics from content:topics: in the root documentation directory.
    - Replace $pos in navOrder with the 1-based index in the array.
    - Replace $today with the current date.
