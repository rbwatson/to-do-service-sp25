# Task Management API Documentation

Welcome to the Task Management API documentation. This API provides a comprehensive solution for managing to-do tasks and users in your applications.

## What is the Task Management API?

## Key features

- **Task management**: Create and manage to-do tasks with due dates and reminders
- **Task statuses**: Track task progress with predefined status values
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large collections of resources
- **Sorting**: Order resources based on specific fields
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by status
