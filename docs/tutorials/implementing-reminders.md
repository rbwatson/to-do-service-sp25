# Implementing reminders

This document provides guidance on how to implement a reminder system using the Task Management API's `warningOffset` property. Learn how to notify users when their tasks are approaching due dates.

## Understanding the warningOffset property

<!-- This section should explain what warningOffset is and how it works -->

- Define what `warningOffset` represents (minutes before due date)
- Explain how it works with the `dueDate` property
- Provide examples of different warning offset values and their practical implications
- Show the calculation: Reminder time = dueDate - warningOffset minutes

## Implementing a basic reminder system

<!-- This section should outline how to implement a basic reminder system -->

- Client-side vs. server-side implementation considerations 
- Polling strategy for checking upcoming reminders
- Suggestions for storing reminder states
- Code example of a reminder checking function
- Example of reminder notification UI

## Advanced reminder patterns

<!-- This section should cover more complex reminder implementations -->

- Multiple reminders for important tasks
- Escalating reminders (increasing frequency as deadline approaches)
- Team/manager notifications for overdue tasks
- Reminder preferences and customization
- Integration with external notification systems (email, SMS, etc.)

## Best practices

<!-- This section should provide recommendations for effective reminder systems -->

- Appropriate warning offset selection based on task importance
- Handling timezone differences
- Dealing with reminder acknowledgments
- Reminder grouping to avoid notification fatigue
- Handling overdue tasks

## Example implementation

<!-- This section should provide a complete code example -->

```javascript
// Example code for a reminder system
```

<!-- Consider adding a diagram showing the reminder calculation process -->
