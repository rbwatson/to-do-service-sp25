# Integration patterns

This document describes common patterns and best practices for integrating the Task Management API with other systems and services in your technology ecosystem.

## Common integration scenarios

<!-- This section should outline different integration scenarios -->

- Integrating with authentication systems
- Connecting with calendar applications
- Incorporating into project management tools
- Adding to communication platforms
- Embedding in productivity suites
- Mobile application integration

## Integration approaches

<!-- This section should explain different integration approaches -->

- Direct API integration
- Webhook-based integration
- Message queue integration
- Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) pattern
- Microservices architecture considerations

## Authentication and security

<!-- This section should cover authentication and security considerations -->

- Token management and security
- Credential handling
- Role-based access control
- API key rotation practices
- Error handling for authentication issues

## Data synchronization patterns

<!-- This section should address data synchronization challenges -->

- One-way vs. two-way synchronization
- Handling conflicts
- Synchronization frequency
- Offline-first considerations
- Dealing with schema differences

## Performance considerations

<!-- This section should provide performance recommendations -->

- Caching strategies
- Rate limiting awareness
- Batch operations
- Connection pooling
- Request optimization

## Implementation examples

<!-- This section should provide code examples for common integrations -->

```javascript
// Examples of integration code
```

<!-- Consider adding a system architecture diagram showing integration points -->

## Case studies

<!-- This section could include brief case studies of integration examples -->

- Calendar integration example
- Project management tool integration
- Mobile app integration

## Related resources

<!-- This section should link to related documentation -->

- Authentication documentation
- API reference
- Error handling guidelines
- Performance optimization resources
