# Handling data consistency

This document outlines strategies for maintaining data consistency when working with the Task Management API, with particular focus on handling race conditions and concurrency issues.

## Understanding consistency challenges

<!-- This section should explain the types of consistency challenges -->

- Race conditions explained
- Optimistic vs. pessimistic concurrency
- Last-write-wins issues
- Lost update problems
- Data staleness considerations
- Eventually consistent systems

## Concurrency control strategies

<!-- This section should outline concurrency control approaches -->

- Optimistic concurrency control
- Conditional updates
- Version-based concurrency
- Resource locking patterns
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Handling update conflicts

## Client-side consistency patterns

<!-- This section should explain client-side approaches -->

- Local state management
- Optimistic UI updates
- Conflict resolution UI
- Offline-first considerations
- Synchronization strategies
- Handling network partitions

## Task-specific consistency challenges

<!-- This section should address task-specific consistency issues -->

- Task status transition race conditions
- Simultaneous task updates
- Task assignment conflicts
- Due date modifications
- Detecting and resolving task conflicts
- Maintaining user-task relationship consistency

## Implementation examples

<!-- This section should provide code examples -->

```javascript
// Examples of consistency handling code
```

<!-- Consider adding a diagram showing race conditions and resolution approaches -->

## Best practices checklist

<!-- This section should provide a consistency checklist -->

- Concurrency control implementation checklist
- Client-side consistency checklist
- Task-specific consistency checklist

<!-- This section should link to related resources -->

- Error handling documentation
- API reference for conditional operations
- Conflict resolution patterns
