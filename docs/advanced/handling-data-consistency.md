# Handling Data Consistency

## Overview

This document outlines strategies and patterns for maintaining data consistency when working with the Task Management API, with a focus on concurrency control, handling race conditions, and ensuring data integrity.

## Content Outline

### 1. Understanding Consistency Challenges
- Common data consistency issues in distributed systems
- Race conditions in task management
- Optimistic vs. pessimistic concurrency control
- Idempotency and its importance

### 2. Handling Concurrent Updates
- Using ETags and conditional requests
- Implementing optimistic locking
- Conflict detection and resolution strategies
- Last-write-wins vs. merge-based approaches

### 3. Transactional Operations
- Lack of true transactions in REST APIs
- Implementing compensating transactions
- Designing for eventual consistency
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### 4. Maintaining Cache Consistency
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Time-to-live (TTL) considerations
- Write-through and write-behind caching
- Cache coherence in distributed environments

### 5. Managing Task State Transitions
- Enforcing valid state transitions
- Handling conflicting state changes
- Implementing state machines for tasks
- Audit trails for state changes

### 6. Handling Partial Failures
- Recovery strategies for incomplete operations
- Implementing retry logic
- Circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- Monitoring and alerting for consistency issues

### 7. Testing for Consistency Issues
- Simulating race conditions in tests
- Load testing for concurrency issues
- Chaos testing for resilience
- Data consistency verification techniques
