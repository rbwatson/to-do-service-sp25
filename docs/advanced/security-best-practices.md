# Security best practices

This document outlines security best practices and considerations when working with the Task Management API to help ensure the safety and privacy of your application and its data.

## Authentication security

<!-- This section should cover authentication-related security practices -->

- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Token lifecycle management
- Token refresh strategies
- Multi-factor authentication integration
- Handling authentication failures
- Detecting and responding to unauthorized access attempts

## Data protection

<!-- This section should address data protection measures -->

- Protecting sensitive task information
- User data privacy considerations
- Data minimization principles
- Client-side data storage security
- Transport layer security requirements
- Secure handling of personally identifiable information (PII)

## Access control

<!-- This section should explain access control approaches -->

- Implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
