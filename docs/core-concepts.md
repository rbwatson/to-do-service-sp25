# Core Concepts

This section covers the fundamental concepts and patterns used throughout the Task Management API. Understanding these concepts will help you work with the API more effectively.

## In This Section

The Core Concepts section contains the following topics:

| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Data Model](core-concepts/data-model.md) | Overview of the core resources and their relationships |
| [Pagination](core-concepts/pagination.md) | How to navigate through large collections of resources |
| [Sorting](core-concepts/sorting.md) | How to sort API results using sort parameters |
| [Error Handling](core-concepts/error-handling.md) | Common error patterns and how to handle them |
| [Task Status Lifecycle](core-concepts/task-status-lifecycle.md) | Understanding task statuses and transitions |

## API Design Principles

The Task Management API follows these design principles:

- **RESTful Resources**: The API is organized around resources with standard HTTP methods
- **JSON Formatting**: All requests and responses use JSON format
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar patterns are used across different endpoints for a consistent developer experience
- **Clear Error Messages**: Error responses include detailed information to help you troubleshoot issues
- **Stateless Operation**: Each request contains all the information needed to complete the operation

## Resources

The Task Management API centers around two main resources:

1. **Users**: Individuals who can create and be assigned to tasks
2. **Tasks**: Work items that have various properties like title, description, status, and deadlines

Each resource has its own set of endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting instances.

## Next Steps

After understanding these core concepts, you can:

- Explore the detailed [API Resources](resources.md) documentation
- Check out the [API Reference](api-reference.md) for specific endpoint details
- Try out the concepts in our [Tutorials & Guides](tutorials.md)
