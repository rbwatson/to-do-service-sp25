# Data Model

The Task Management API is built around two primary resources: Users and Tasks. This page explains these resources, their properties, and how they relate to each other.

## Core Resources

### Users

Users represent individuals who can create and be assigned to tasks. Each user has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Unique identifier for the user |
| `name` | String | Full name of the user |
| `email` | String | Email address of the user (must be unique) |
| `role` | String | Role of the user (default: "member") |
| `createdAt` | Date | When the user was created |
| `updatedAt` | Date | When the user was last updated |

### Tasks

Tasks represent work items that need to be completed. Each task has the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `id` | String | Unique identifier for the task |
| `title` | String | Title of the task |
| `description` | String | Detailed description of the task (optional) |
| `status` | String | Current status of the task (e.g., "TODO", "IN_PROGRESS", "DONE") |
| `priority` | String | Priority level (e.g., "LOW", "MEDIUM", "HIGH") |
| `createdBy` | String | ID of the user who created the task |
| `assigneeId` | String | ID of the user assigned to the task (optional) |
| `dueDate` | Date | When the task is due (optional) |
| `warningOffset` | Number | Hours before due date to send a reminder (optional) |
| `tags` | Array | Array of string tags associated with the task (optional) |
| `createdAt` | Date | When the task was created |
| `updatedAt` | Date | When the task was last updated |

## Resource Relationships

The relationships between resources in the Task Management API are as follows:

1. **User to Tasks (Creation)**: A user can create multiple tasks. Each task has a `createdBy` field that references the user who created it.

2. **User to Tasks (Assignment)**: A user can be assigned to multiple tasks. Each task has an optional `assigneeId` field that references the assigned user.

3. **Task to User**: A task can be assigned to at most one user at a time. The `assigneeId` field references the assigned user's ID.

## Enumerations

### Task Status

Task status represents the current state of a task in its lifecycle:

- `TODO`: Task has been created but work hasn't started
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Work on the task has begun
- `REVIEW`: Task is completed and awaiting review
- `DONE`: Task has been completed and approved
- `CANCELED`: Task has been canceled and won't be completed

### Task Priority

Priority indicates the importance level of a task:

- `LOW`: Low priority task
- `MEDIUM`: Medium priority task (default)
- `HIGH`: High priority task
- `URGENT`: Urgent task requiring immediate attention

### User Role

User roles determine the permissions a user has:

- `admin`: Can perform all operations
- `manager`: Can manage tasks and assign them to users
- `member`: Can create and update their own tasks (default)

## Important Notes

- All IDs are automatically generated by the API and are guaranteed to be unique.
- Timestamps (`createdAt` and `updatedAt`) are automatically managed by the API.
- When creating a task, the `createdBy` field is automatically set to the authenticated user's ID.
- The `email` field on the User resource must be unique across all users.
