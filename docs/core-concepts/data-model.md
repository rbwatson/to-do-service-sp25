# Data model

The Task Management API is built around two main resources: Users and Tasks. This page provides an overview of these resources and their relationships.

## Resource relationships

The relationship between Users and Tasks is a one-to-many relationship:

- A User can have multiple Tasks
- Each Task belongs to exactly one User

This relationship is enforced by the `userId` field on the Task resource, which references the User who owns the task.

## User resource

The User resource represents an individual who can create and manage tasks in the system.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Required | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| userId | integer | Unique identifier for the user | Yes (generated) | Generated by the API |
| firstName | string | User's first name | Yes | 1-100 characters |
| lastName | string | User's last name | Yes | 1-100 characters |
| contactEmail | string | User's email address | Yes | Valid email format, 3-255 characters |

For more details, see the [User resource](../resources/user-resource.md) documentation.

## Task resource

The Task resource represents a to-do item that belongs to a user.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Required | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| taskId | integer | Unique identifier for the task | Yes (generated) | Generated by the API |
| userId | integer | ID of the user who owns the task | Yes | Must reference a valid user |
| taskTitle | string | Short description of the task | Yes | 1-80 characters |
| taskDescription | string | Detailed description of the task | No | 1-255 characters |
| taskStatus | string | Current status of the task | Yes (default: NOT_STARTED) | Must be one of the predefined status values |
| dueDate | string (date-time) | When the task is due | Yes | ISO 8601 format |
| warningOffset | integer | Minutes before due date to send reminder | Yes | 0-64000 |

For more details, see the [Task resource](../resources/task-resource.md) documentation.

## Task status values

The `taskStatus` field can have one of the following values:

- NOT_STARTED: The task has not been started yet
- IN_PROGRESS: The task is currently being worked on
- BLOCKED: The task cannot proceed due to an external factor
- DEFERRED: The task has been postponed to a later time
- COMPLETED: The task has been finished
- CANCELLED: The task has been cancelled and will not be completed

For more details on task status transitions, see the [Task status lifecycle](task-status-lifecycle.md) documentation.

## Error resource

The API also defines an Error resource format for error responses.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Required |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|
| code | string | Error code identifying the type of error | Yes |
| message | string | Human-readable error message | Yes |
| details | array | Additional error details when available | No |
| requestId | string | Request identifier for troubleshooting | No |

For more details on error handling, see the [Error handling](error-handling.md) documentation.
