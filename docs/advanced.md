# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced considerations for working with the Task Management API. These topics are intended for developers who are already familiar with the API basics and want to optimize their implementation.

## Performance optimization

Performance optimization is critical for providing a responsive user experience. The [Optimizing API usage](advanced/optimizing-api-usage.md) guide covers techniques for reducing latency and minimizing server load:

- Implementing client-side caching
- Using pagination effectively
- Minimizing the number of API requests
- Batch operations best practices

## Security

Security is a crucial aspect of any API integration. The [Security best practices](advanced/security-best-practices.md) guide provides recommendations for keeping your implementation secure:

- Secure token handling
- Authorization best practices
- Input validation
- Handling sensitive data
- Preventing common vulnerabilities

## Data consistency

Maintaining data consistency is important for providing a reliable user experience. The [Handling data consistency](advanced/handling-data-consistency.md) guide covers strategies for dealing with concurrency issues:

- Optimistic vs. pessimistic concurrency control
- Handling race conditions
- Implementing retry logic
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Available advanced guides
