# User resource

The User resource represents an individual who can create and manage tasks in the Task Management API. Users must be created before tasks can be associated with them.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description | Required | Constraints |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `userId` | integer | The unique identifier for the user | Yes (generated) | System-generated, read-only |
| `firstName` | string | The user's first name | Yes | 1-100 characters |
| `lastName` | string | The user's last name | Yes | 1-100 characters |
| `contactEmail` | string | The user's email address | Yes | Valid email format, 3-255 characters |

## User representation

A User resource is represented in JSON format:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "contactEmail": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

## Creating a user

To create a user, send a POST request to the `/users` endpoint with the required user information:

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "contactEmail": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

The API will generate a unique `userId` for the new user.

For detailed information, see the [Create a user](../api-reference/create-user.md) endpoint documentation.

## Retrieving users

### Get all users

To retrieve all users, send a GET request to the `/users` endpoint. The response will include an array of user objects:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "userId": 1,
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "contactEmail": "john.doe@example.com"
    },
    {
      "userId": 2,
      "firstName": "Jane",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "contactEmail": "jane.smith@example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

This endpoint supports pagination and sorting. For detailed information, see the [Get all users](../api-reference/get-all-users.md) endpoint documentation.

### Get a specific user

To retrieve a specific user, send a GET request to the `/users/{userId}` endpoint, where `{userId}` is the unique identifier of the user:

```
GET /users/1
```

For detailed information, see the [Get user by ID](../api-reference/get-user-by-id.md) endpoint documentation.

## Updating a user

To update a user, send a PATCH request to the `/users/{userId}` endpoint with the fields you want to update:

```json
{
  "contactEmail": "new.email@example.com"
}
```

The API supports partial updates, so you only need to include the fields you want to change.

For detailed information, see the [Update a user](../api-reference/update-user.md) endpoint documentation.

## Deleting a user

To delete a user, send a DELETE request to the `/users/{userId}` endpoint:

```
DELETE /users/1
```

For detailed information, see the [Delete a user](../api-reference/delete-user.md) endpoint documentation.

## Related resources

The User resource is related to the Task resource. A user can have multiple tasks associated with them through the `userId` field on the Task resource.

To retrieve all tasks for a user, you can filter the tasks endpoint by the user ID:

```
GET /tasks?userId=1
```

## Important considerations

- The `contactEmail` must be unique across all users in the system.
- When a user is deleted, all associated tasks should be deleted as well (cascade delete).
- The `userId` is generated by the system and cannot be specified when creating a user.

## Best practices

1. **Validate email addresses**: Although the API validates email format, it's good practice to validate email addresses in your client application before sending requests.
2. **Handle unique email constraints**: Be prepared to handle errors if you try to create a user with an email that already exists.
3. **Implement proper authentication**: Ensure that users can only access and modify their own data by implementing proper authentication and authorization in your application.
