# Authentication

The Task Management API uses bearer token authentication to secure all endpoints. This guide explains how to authenticate your requests.

## Bearer token authentication

Bearer token authentication is a simple HTTP authentication scheme that uses security tokens called "bearer tokens." The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources.

## Authentication header

For all API requests, include the bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

Replace `your-token-here` with your actual bearer token.

## Example request with authentication

Here's an example of making an authenticated request to get all users:

```bash
# cURL example
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token-here"
```

```python
# Python example
import requests

url = "http://localhost:3000/users"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer your-token-here"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

```javascript
// JavaScript example
fetch('http://localhost:3000/users', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer your-token-here'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Authentication errors

If you don't include a valid token, the API will respond with one of these errors:

### Missing authentication

If you don't include an Authorization header, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Authentication is required to access this resource",
  "requestId": "req-f8d31a62-e789-4856-9452-5efa50223c7a"
}
```

### Invalid token

If you include an invalid or expired token, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Authentication is required to access this resource",
  "requestId": "req-f8d31a62-e789-4856-9452-5efa50223c7a"
}
```

### Insufficient permissions

If your token is valid but doesn't have permission to access a specific resource, you'll receive a `403 Forbidden` response:

```json
{
  "code": "FORBIDDEN",
  "message": "You do not have permission to access this resource",
  "requestId": "req-f8d31a62-e789-4856-9452-5efa50223c7a"
}
```

## Best practices

1. Store tokens securely and never expose them in client-side code or URLs
2. Implement token refresh mechanisms for long-lived applications
3. Always use HTTPS to prevent token interception
4. Revoke tokens when they're no longer needed
