# Rate limiting

The Task Management API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and system stability. This document explains how rate limiting works and how to handle rate limit responses.

## Rate limit overview

<!-- This section should explain the basic concept of rate limiting and why it's necessary -->

- Explain the purpose of rate limiting
- Detail the current rate limits (requests per minute/hour)
- Describe how limits are applied (per token, IP address, or user)
- Note any endpoints with special rate limits

## Rate limit headers

<!-- This section should list and describe the response headers related to rate limiting -->

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum number of requests allowed in a time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the current rate limit window resets (Unix timestamp)

## Handling rate limit exceeded responses

<!-- This section should explain what happens when rate limits are exceeded and how to handle it -->

- Explain the 429 Too Many Requests response
- Detail the Retry-After header and its usage
- Provide code examples for handling rate limit errors
- Suggest exponential backoff strategies

## Best practices

<!-- This section should provide recommendations for working within rate limits -->

- Implement request caching where appropriate
- Use bulk operations instead of multiple single requests
- Monitor rate limit headers proactively
- Implement graceful degradation when limits are approached

## Rate limit increase requests

<!-- This section should explain if and how rate limits can be increased -->

- Process for requesting increased rate limits
- Criteria for rate limit increases
- Contact information for support

## Example implementation

<!-- This section should include a code example showing how to handle rate limits -->

```javascript
// Example code for handling rate limits
```

<!-- Consider adding a diagram showing the rate limiting process -->
