# Rate Limiting

## Overview

This document outlines the rate limiting policies for the Task Management API, how to recognize when you've hit a rate limit, and strategies for handling rate limiting in your applications.

## Content Outline

### 1. Introduction to Rate Limiting
- Purpose of rate limiting (protect API infrastructure, ensure fair usage)
- How rate limits are structured (requests per minute, per hour, etc.)
- Different rate limit tiers by account type

### 2. Rate Limit Headers
- X-RateLimit-Limit header explanation
- X-RateLimit-Remaining header explanation
- X-RateLimit-Reset header explanation
- Example response headers

### 3. Rate Limit Response Codes
- 429 Too Many Requests response
- Sample rate limit error response
- Retry-After header usage

### 4. Best Practices for Handling Rate Limits
- Implementing exponential backoff
- Monitoring rate limit headers preemptively
- Optimizing requests to reduce API calls
- Caching strategies to reduce request volume

### 5. Rate Limits by Endpoint
- Table of endpoints with their specific rate limits
- Special considerations for high-volume endpoints

### 6. Requesting Rate Limit Increases
- Process for requesting higher rate limits
- Requirements and considerations
- Contact information for support
