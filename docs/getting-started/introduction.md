# Introduction to the Task Management API

The Task Management API is a comprehensive solution for creating and managing to-do tasks and users. This RESTful API provides all the tools needed to build robust task management applications with features for tracking task status, setting deadlines, and managing reminders.

## Key features

- **User management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete user accounts
- **Task management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks with support for various status values
- **Task status lifecycle**: Track tasks through their complete lifecycle from creation to completion
- **Due dates and reminders**: Set due dates for tasks with configurable warning offsets for reminders
- **Pagination and sorting**: Efficiently navigate through large collections of resources
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Clear error messages and status codes for troubleshooting

## Use cases

The Task Management API is designed to support a wide range of applications, including:

- Personal to-do list applications
- Team task management tools
- Project management systems
- Reminder and calendar applications
- Productivity trackers

## Getting started

To start using the Task Management API:

1. Review the [Quick start guide](quickstart.html) to set up your development environment
2. Learn how to [authenticate](authentication.html) your API requests
3. Understand the [rate limits](rate-limiting.html) to ensure uninterrupted service

## API design principles

The Task Management API follows RESTful design principles with consistent patterns for resource naming, HTTP methods, and response formats. Key design elements include:

- Resource-based URL structure
- Appropriate use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- JSON request and response bodies
- Consistent error handling
- Bearer token authentication

This API documentation provides all the information needed to effectively utilize the Task Management API in your applications.
