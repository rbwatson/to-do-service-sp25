# Introduction to the Task Management API

The Task Management API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for creating and managing to-do tasks and users. This API enables developers to build task management features into their applications with minimal effort.

## Capabilities

The Task Management API offers the following capabilities:

- **User management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete user accounts
- **Task management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete to-do tasks
- **Task lifecycle**: Track task progress through various statuses
- **Reminders**: Set warning offsets to trigger reminders before due dates
- **Pagination**: Navigate through large collections of resources
- **Sorting**: Order resources based on specific fields
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by status

## Key features

### User management

The API provides endpoints for managing user accounts, including:

- Creating new users with first name, last name, and contact email
- Retrieving user information by ID
- Updating user information
- Deleting user accounts

### Task management

The API provides endpoints for managing tasks, including:

- Creating new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and warning offsets
- Retrieving task information by ID
- Updating task information, including status changes
- Deleting tasks

### Task lifecycle

Tasks can have one of the following statuses:

- NOT_STARTED: The task has not been started yet
- IN_PROGRESS: The task is currently being worked on
- BLOCKED: The task cannot proceed due to an external factor
- DEFERRED: The task has been postponed to a later time
- COMPLETED: The task has been finished
- CANCELLED: The task has been cancelled and will not be completed

### Reminders

The API supports setting a warning offset (in minutes) before a task's due date. This can be used to implement reminder functionality in your application.

## Use cases

The Task Management API can be used for a variety of applications, including:

- Personal to-do list applications
- Team task management systems
- Project management tools
- Calendar and scheduling applications
- Reminder and notification systems

## API structure

The API is organized around two primary resources:

- **Users**: Individuals who can create and manage tasks
- **Tasks**: To-do items with titles, descriptions, due dates, and statuses

Each resource supports standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) via RESTful endpoints.
